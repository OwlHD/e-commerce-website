# eCommerce Website

https://e-commerce-website-two-theta.vercel.app/

This is a sample eCommerce website built using react, bootstrap, and the api from https://fakestoreapi.com/docs.

You can browse all products, filter/sort the products, and add items to a cart, then change or remove them if needed.  The cart persists across sessions.  
You can also log in, which will grab that user's cart from the API and view a user profile.  Due to the nature of the API, there is a mock register form but it will not add
the created user to the database.  To login, use one of the following pre-determined username/password combinations:

        username: johnd
        password: m38rmF$

        username: mor_2314
        password: 83r5^_

        password: kev02937@
